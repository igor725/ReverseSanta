# ReverseSanta

This is my attempt to reverse engineer original Joymania's game called Santa Claus in Trouble,
I'm trying to do such thing without using any dissasembling tools like IDA, Ghidra, x64dbg, etc.
You're probably wondering why am I doing this, and there is an answer for your question: I don't know. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Since I don't use any dissasembling tools, my implementation is completely inaccurate to the original game,
but I think it is playable from start to finish (Haven't tested it yet).
There is no something like installation guide or precompiled binaries, so you'll have to guess how to make this shit run.
